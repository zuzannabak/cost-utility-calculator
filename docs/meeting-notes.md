# Summary

The meeting focused on discussing a research project related to cost modeling and data labeling. Professor Dragut and Zuzanna Monika Bak engaged in a detailed discussion about improving their current approach to cost estimation and model development.

Professor Dragut raised concerns about the time unit standardization in their cost calculations, suggesting that the current per-instance pricing model should be converted to an hourly rate basis. For example, if it costs $16 per instance but takes an hour to process five instances, this should be reflected in the hourly cost calculations.

The discussion then evolved into exploring the possibility of creating a more dynamic framework that could accommodate multiple dimensions beyond the current two-dimensional model. Professor Dragut proposed adding features like tool building costs, software development time, and different types of labeling costs (layman vs. expert).

A significant portion of the conversation centered on the potential for learning from past studies and implementing similarity-based predictions. They discussed the possibility of using synthetic data for simulations and leveraging ChatGPT to find similar research papers in the field.

The meeting concluded with a discussion about report structure and future meetings, as both participants would be traveling in the coming weeks.

# Chapter

## Cost Calculation Standardization Discussion

Professor Dragut initiated a discussion about standardizing cost calculations, suggesting the conversion of per-instance costs to hourly rates. Zuzanna acknowledged the current approach uses diminishing returns curves based on per-label costs found in existing papers.

## Dynamic Framework Proposal

Professor Dragut proposed expanding the current two-dimensional model to include multiple dimensions such as tool building costs, software development time, and different types of labeling costs. This would create a more comprehensive and flexible framework for cost estimation.

## Learning from Past Studies

Discussion shifted to leveraging historical data and implementing similarity-based predictions for new tasks. The possibility of using synthetic data and finding similar research papers through ChatGPT was explored.

## Report Structure and Timeline

Professor Dragut outlined the required structure for the final report, including sections for abstract, introduction, motivation, related work, methodology, experiments, discussion, and future directions.
